### Overview
**Felice** is a simple rhythm game I created around the time I was 19, using P5.js as the foundation. It was during the early days of my programming journey, so it's a bit rough around the edges and has its fair share of bugs. However, I put a lot of effort into incorporating various beautiful graphical effects, and I hope you'll have a fun experience playing it :)

I plan to optimize the code and add more songs in the future, so please look forward to it ´･ᴗ･`

### Game Overview and How to Play

**Felice** is a simple rhythm game that you can enjoy with just a one key 'z'. There are a total of two stages, and players can choose the map they want to play. The game ends when you clear the song with the appropriate difficulty!

**Gameplay:**
- **Pre-game:** Click the gear icon to choose a difficulty, and select a stage.
- **In-game:** Press the Z key in time with the beat to eliminate the approaching circles. If you hold out until the end, you win!

**Controls:**
- **Z:** Remove circle
